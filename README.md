## Machine learning tasks in Python. 
The tasks focused in particular on building neural networks using the Keras library, which included the following:
- Build and compare Neural Network (only with dense layers) models to deal with [classification](https://github.com/Paulina-Iwach/Machine-Learning/blob/master/Assignment_2_Keras_Neural_Network/Assigment%202%20-%20classification%20task.ipynb) and [regression](https://github.com/Paulina-Iwach/Machine-Learning/blob/master/Assignment_2_Keras_Neural_Network/Assigment%202%20-%20Regression%20task.ipynb) problem.
